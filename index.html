      <p>I will be in 11th grade this fall. I live with my mom and two younger siblings.
      I like to listen to music, hang out with friends and family, and play sports.
      If I had to choose what my favorite sport is, it would be a tie between volleyball and soccer.
      My favorite color is royal blue.
      I played the clarinet for three years. I am teaching myself how to play the piano.
      My birthday is October 21.</p>
